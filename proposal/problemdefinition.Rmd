## What the problem is

R is used throughout the world.  The Revolution Analytics [Local R User Group Directory](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html) lists RUGs in almost 50 countries, but there is a strong bias towards groups in English-speaking nations.  **TODO: plot of number of RUGs in english-speaking countries vs. non-english-speaking countries.**

R has been translated into [20 languages](http://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html) but currently not many packages have translations **TODO: download all packages from CRAN, count how many have a po dir, and how many translations are in each; maybe draw a histogram.**

## Who it affects

For users who are not native speakers of English, the lack of localized content at best constitutes a productivity drain (since it takes longer to understand what an error message means), and at worst may discourage them from using R instead of a tools which fully supports their language.

## Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem?

There are some resources for available for translation, but both the documentation and R functions have problems.

The official documentation is split between three sources:  
1. The [Internationalization](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Internationalization) section of *Writing R Extensions*.  
2. The [Localization of messages](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Localization-of-messages) section of *R Installation and Administration*.  
3. The [Translations](http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html) page of the *R Developer Guidance*.  

There is currently no single, developer-friendly docuemtn that decribes how to translate your package content.

The `tools` package in the base-R distribution provide some functionality for working with the translation files, but manual editing of the files is often required, and errors are hard to debug.

Beyond this, finding multi-lingual R programmers with enough free time to undertake translation duties is even harder. 

## Why it should be tackled

In order for R to take over the world (of data analysis), better tools are needed to encourage package developers to have their content translated.

## How does this project align with the R Consortium's goals?

This project will align with the R Consortium's goals, particularly:

(a) advance the worldwide promotion of and support for the R open source language and environment as the preferred language for statistical computing and graphics (the “Environment”);

By providing better translation tools, R will be easier to use in parts of the world where English is not the first language of the population.

(c) encourage and increase user adoption, involvement with, and contribution to, the Environment; 

By making R easier to use for these non-English speaking demographics, it will increase user adoption.
