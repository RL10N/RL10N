# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

Feedback from R package developers on the quality and ease of use of the tools that we develop will be sought using social media, particularly blog posts syndicated on R Bloggers and twitter.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

- The developers will hold a meeting once per week in order to discuss progress and future project strategy. 
- Individual issues will be handled via github's issue tracking functionality.
- The developers will provide a progress report to the ISC once per month.


## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

The project relies on several external cloud computing tools: Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Translate, and Microsoft Translator.  Direct interfacing with these tools is not within the scope of the project; the interfaces already exist.

Within the scope of the project, R is the only required tool.

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

Funding will primarily cover development time, with the remainder used towards the paid-for services on Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Translate, and Microsoft Translator.  The budget breakdown

- $9000 for the development of three R packages, split evenly between the two developers.
- $600 for the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- $200 for the use of Google Translate.
- $200 for the use of Microsoft Translator.

## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

This project has few external dependencies and risks, being focussed on the development of R packages.
