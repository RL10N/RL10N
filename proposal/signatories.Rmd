# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.

## Project team
<!-- 
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to go?
-->

The project team consists of Richie Cotton and Thomas Leeper.

Richie Cotton is a data scientist in the proteomics team at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar.  He has been using R for 11 years, is the author of many R packages (including 24 packages on CRAN), and has written two books on R: Learning R and the forthcoming Testing R Code.

Thomas Leeper is assistant professor in political behaviour at The London School of Economics and Political Science.  He is the author of 14 packages on CRAN and contributor to many more, including the *msgtools* and *MTurkR* packages which are the focus of this project.
